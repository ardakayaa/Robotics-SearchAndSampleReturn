# Introduction
- This is my first project for the Udacity's Robotics Nanodegree.
- This project is modeled after
the [NASA Sample and Return Challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/sample_return_robot/index.html).
- Fulfillment of this project gives first hand experience on the three essential elements of robotics, which are perception, decision making and actuation. The project is carried out in a simulator environment built with the Unity game engine.
- For more information about this project, check
